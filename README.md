## Overview
This app holds a special place in my heart as it solves a personal problem: the inflexibility of pomodoro timers. The problem with traditional pomodoros is that it stops you abruptly in the middle of your work, interrupting your focus and flow state. 

How Flowdoro solves this problem is by implementing two timers. The first timer is a soft and gentle alert to let you know that the initial time is up, but allowing you to continue as needed to finish up whatever is left. The second timer is a harsher and louder timer, signaling the end of a cycle. The second timer represents the "flow" state, this serves to allow you to come to a more natural stop, increasing your productivity!

You can tap the plus icon in the top right corner of the pomodoro tab to create new tasks. Adjust the focus, flow, and break timer durations by tapping the blue buttons up top. Feel free to skip, pause, and end cycles as needed. Your study stats, both daily and total, will be visually displayed on charts and graphs in the stats tab to keep you engaged and motivated!
